# PRD: Early Lifecycle Retention & Feature Adoption

## Problem
Overall churn is 26.58%. Churn is concentrated among early-lifecycle customers (0–12 months churn: 47.7%) and month-to-month customers (42.7%). Customers without TechSupport churn at 41.6% vs 15.2% with TechSupport.

## Goal
Reduce 0–12 month churn from 47.7% to ~40% via improved early value realization and feature adoption.

## Primary Users
New customers in first 12 months, especially month-to-month customers who have not adopted high-value features.

## Proposed Solution (MVP)
- Guided onboarding checklist (first 7 days)
- Feature activation nudges for high-value features (TechSupport, OnlineSecurity)
- “Value milestone” messaging (show tangible benefit early)
- Targeted contract upgrade prompt after activation milestone

## Success Metrics
Primary: 30-day churn for new customers
Secondary: Feature activation within 30 days; conversion to 1-year contract
Guardrails: onboarding completion time; support ticket volume
