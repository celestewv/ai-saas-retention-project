# Experiment Plan: Onboarding + Activation Nudges

## Hypothesis
Improving onboarding and early feature activation will reduce churn among 0–12 month customers.

## Design
A/B test:
- Control: current onboarding experience
- Variant: guided onboarding + TechSupport/OnlineSecurity nudges

## Primary Metric
0–12 month segment churn (30-day churn proxy)

## Secondary Metrics
Feature activation within 30 days; contract upgrade rate

## Guardrails
Support ticket volume; onboarding completion time; drop in conversion
